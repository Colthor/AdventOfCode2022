# AdventOfCode2022

My repo for Advent Of Code 2022 - https://adventofcode.com/

Personal challenge: use as many different languages as possible. I decided that on day 3 when I'd already used two easy ones...

+ Day 1 - C++
+ Day 2 - Python 3
+ Day 3 - Bash script (new language for me)
+ Day 4 - BBC BASIC - bbcbasic.co.uk - party like it's 1989! (My first programming language :D)
+ Day 5 - Free Pascal (new language!)
+ Day 6 - Prolog
+ Day 7 - VB.NET (2008 :s )
+ Day 8 - Zig (new language, and harder than I anticipated.)
+ Day 9 - Ada - I used Alire, which was my only installation attempt that worked (new language, bad VS code support, unhelpful compiler. A more ornery Pascal.)
+ Day 10 - Haskell. Probably haven't used this since the first year of university.
+ Day 11 - TypeScript. Not quite new, I'd done "Hello World" before ;)
+ Day 12 - C. I haven't written good old-fashioned C in ages!
+ Day 13 - PureScript (new language? It's basically Haskell) with JS (in the .html file) to generate the code/data to put in main.purs.
+ Day 14 - Ruby (new language!)
+ Day 15 - Julia (new language!)
+ Day 16 - C#. I like C#. This was an incredibly hard problem and my solution is very bad though. If the answer to part 2 weren't at the beginning of the problem space it'd still be looking for it...
+ Day 17 - Turing and a calculator for part 2, because OpenTuring doesn't support 64-bit ints :D (Another language from University - a less ornery Pascal.)
+ Day 18 - SQL (for SQL Server 2012-ish)
+ Day 19 - Java
+ Day 20 - Clojure (new language, and probably the only one where the language was harder than the problem. Functional programming hurts my tiny brain.)
+ Day 21 - PHP (New language! Struggled with the algebra for p2 because the example was a special case that I happened to get right straight away.)
+ Day 22 - Kotlin, paper, pen and scissors (new language, and quite a nice one at that. Mind that ranges are inclusive :) )
+ Day 23 - Go (Kinda new.. I'd never written it before, but had watched a "learn Go in three hours" series)
+ Day 24 - Rust, one of my favourite languages.
