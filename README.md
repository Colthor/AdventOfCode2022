# AdventOfCode2022

My repo for Advent Of Code 2022 - https://adventofcode.com/

Personal challenge: use as many different languages as possible. I decided that on day 3 when I'd already used two easy ones...

+ Day 1 - C++
+ Day 2 - Python 3
+ Day 3 - Bash script (New language for me)
+ Day 4 - BBC BASIC - bbcbasic.co.uk - party like it's 1989! (My first programming language :D)
